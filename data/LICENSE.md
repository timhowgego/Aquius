# Data License

Dataset copyright differs from Aquius' codebase, and no licensing guarantees of data can be given unless made explicit by all entities represented within the dataset. Be warned that no protection is afforded by the _logical nonsense_ of a public transport operator attempting to deny the public dissemination of their public operations. Nor should government-owned companies or state concessionaires be naively presumed to operate in some kind of public domain. Railways, in particular, can accumulate all manner of arcane legislation and strategic national paranoias. In the era of Google many public transport operators have grown less controlling of their information channels, but traditional entities, [such as Renfe](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/madrid/2018-07-17/transparencia-retrasos-cercanias-madrid_1593408/), are not yet beyond claiming basic observable information as a trade secret. Your mileage may vary.

## Spanish Railways (es-rail-20-jul-2018.json)

The Spanish Railway dataset is a creative work of academic curiosity, a limited snapshot of one day in history. The original creator makes no claim of ownership to any data therein, nor should be held responsible for its accuracy. Such can therefore be used as "freely" as its source. In particular, note that the contents of Renfe's website is claimed as an intellectual property whose reuse is "[totalmente prohibida](http://www.renfe.com/empresa/informacion_legal/CGUsoWeb.html)", however the work of the dataset may reasonably be judged creative, with no specific items of Renfe Operadora data reused in their original form. Non-operational information is based on sources whose reused is licensed more freely: Population data is "Prepared with data extracted from the INE website: [www.ine.es](http://www.ine.es/)", apparently with no restriction on reuse beyond that statement. Municipality centroids CC BY 4.0 from [Instituto Geográfico Nacional de España](http://www.ign.es/). National network station nodes were originally from the [IDEAADIF](http://ideadif.adif.es/) (INSPIRE) dataset, apparently under the same license.
