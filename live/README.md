## Àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona

[![Aquius at Plaça Catalunya](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/static/aquius-placa-catalunya.jpg)](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#r1/p2/s4/z13/tca-ES)

[AMB (26 November-2 December 2018)](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/): Snapshot of all non-tourist scheduled public transport within the [Àrea Metropolitana de Barcelona](http://www.amb.cat/) (AMB) - [more information about this dataset](https://timhowgego.github.io/AquiusData/es-amb/). Of Interest:

* Bounded Buses: [Torrassa](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.11864/y41.3648/z14/c2.11658/k41.36869/m13/r1/n0) is one of the most densely populated places in Europe, so should be ideal territory for public transport. But because of the administrative structure of bus concessions, none of Torrassa's bus services connect with the city of Barcelona, a mere kilometre away. The connection is ostensibly affected by one (extremely busy) metro line. Filter for bus only and the issue is clear to see. [Sants](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.14783/y41.37829/z13/c2.1401/k41.37707/m13/r1/n2), on the opposite side of that administrative boundary, is much better connected by bus, including some very long routes across the city, whose distance is perhaps better suited to rail. But for relatively short, local trips towards Hospitalet, there are no bus routes.
* Contemporary Shopping: [Virrei Amat](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.17632/y41.42555/z13/c2.17504/k41.42973/m14/r2/n0/p2) is the most important traditional commercial shopping street in northern Barcelona, and even without including Fabra i Puig (a hub of interurban services), Virrei Amat retains strong public transport connectivity. Nearby [La Maquinista](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.19701/y41.43645/z14/c2.1983/k41.44035/m14/r2/n0/p2) is one of the largest modern shopping "malls" in Barcelona, albeit in a formally quite industrial area with little residential population, making La Maquinista more reliant on non-pedestrian transport. Virrei Amat's public transport connections are about 50% better than La Maquinista. But La Maquinista still has twice as much connectivity as its forgotten sibling, [Heron City](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.18671/y41.43497/z14/c2.1819/k41.43494/m14/r2/n0/p2), which was sited _just_ too far from every major public transport corridor in the area.
* Night and Day: [Sarrià's daytime bus service](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.14354/y41.40057/z13/c2.12568/k41.39941/m14/n2/p1/r0) offers less direct connectivity than its [night-time bus service](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.14354/y41.40057/z13/c2.12568/k41.39941/m14/n2/p1/r4). Indeed even with rail, Sarrià is only marginally better connected in the day than in the night. This pattern is not uncommon: The best connected place in whole area, [Plaça Catalunya](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.17255/y41.38756/z13/c2.171/k41.38789/m14/p1), is [better connected at night](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-2018/#x2.17255/y41.38756/z13/c2.171/k41.38789/m14/p1/r4) - albeit not at high frequency. TMB's daytime network is intended to require interchange, quite unlike the Nitbus network. However the comparison of night and day highlights weaknesses in TMB's network design, suggesting the importance of connecting people has become secondary to the importance of network visibility.

### AMB Vortex

[![Aquius at Torrassa with Barcelona Metro Line 9/10 Connection](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/static/aquius-barcelona-l9-l10.jpg)](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.11985/k41.36972/m13/x2.153/y41.3832/z12/p2/r2/s3/tca-ES)

[AMB Vortex (26 November-2 December 2018)](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/): As above, but in a fixed coordinate grid, ideal for strategic analysis. Includes sample proposed network changes:

* [Diagonal tram](http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/mobilitat/tramviaconnectat/es) (direct on-street route): [Sant Joan Despí](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.0695/k41.365/m12/x2.14371/y41.38125/z13/r1) is one of the main beneficiaries of the connection ([vs 2018 network](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.0695/k41.365/m12/x2.14371/y41.38125/z13)), but even here the additional connectivity offered is quite modest: Unlike Hospitalet (see Bounded Buses above), TMB already operate bus through toward the city of Barcelona, and parts Sant Joan Despí and Cornallà already have access to (metro and Rodalies) railways which serve much the same broad axis as the tram. [La Mina](#c2.219968/k41.419994/m16/x2.1907/y41.3896/z12/r1), a particularly deprived "edge-of-nowhere" urbanisation clearly gains, but primarily in connections to the less densely populated Llobregat. Connections which, for example, might be somewhat achieved by simply adding a station to the Rodalies network.
* [L9/10 connection](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%ADnia_9_del_metro_de_Barcelona) (with all proposed stations, except those in Zona Franca): [Torrassa](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.119932/k41.369933/m16/x2.1327/y41.3847/z12/r2) demonstrates both the improved connectivity of completing the missing central section, and how perhaps the need for the missing link in part reflects the contrained local bus network. L9/10's emphasis on light-industrial Zona Franca, over the far more populous Cornellà axis, is curioisity of route design that should not need detailed analysis of connectivity to illustrate. However the Vortex map also reveals more unexpected connectivity changes in areas that appear to be already well served, especially at high frequency, such as [northern Gràcia](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.160037/k41.410146/m16/x2.15761/y41.3998/z13/r2/p3).
* [Rodalies 2026](http://territori.gencat.cat/web/.content/home/01_departament/plans/plans_sectorials/mobilitat/pla_dinfraestructures_del_transport_de_catalunya_2006-2026/pitc11transportpublic_tcm32-35012.pdf) (suburban railway as proposed in 2006): This proposal adds no new stations (it actually removes the historic terminus of França), but rather attempts to optimise service patterns to deliver higher frequencies. Plus a somewhat more curious obsession with the transveral Vallès axis - the principle AMB area beneficiary of which, [Sant Cugat](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.0823/k41.4749/m12/x2.0826/y41.4279/z12/r3/p2), cannot be fairly analysed because key destinations such as Matorell and Granollers are outwith the AMB area. The Vortex map does allow assessment of the impact within the AMB area - for example, that Badalona is marginally better connected to metropolitan Barcelona by the [existing rail network](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.25005/k41.44942/m14/x2.1252/y41.3884/z11/r0/p2/n1) and [not the new](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/amb-vortex-2018/#c2.25005/k41.44942/m14/x2.1252/y41.3884/z11/r3/p2/n1), while AMB area connectivity is net similiar for [Montcada i Reixac](#c2.1849/k41.4875/m11/x2.0991/y41.3838/z11/r3/p2/n1). [Airport connectivity](#c2.0706/k41.2997/m12/x2.1245/y41.3575/z11/r3/p2/n0) is improved, although the L9/10 connection improves it by significantly more.

Those examples are not intended to replace detailed (but specific) analysis of proposals in isolation. Rather to show how quite different proposals can be considered in their shared context - which for cities can otherwise be extremely difficult to comprehend. And Aquius doesn't just allow networks to better understood: Even without a proper interface (proposed routes currently need to be outlined in GIS software, base networks filtered appropriately, and the combination rebuilt), the networks demonstrated here can be built and probed in a matter of minutes.

## FlixBus

[FlixBus (20-26 August 2018](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/flixbus-aug-2018/): Snapshot of all European FlixBus (and FlixTrain) services - [more information about this dataset](https://timhowgego.github.io/AquiusData/eu-interbus/).

The FlixBus network is almost impossible to communicate on a fixed map because its service patterns are often defined by cabotage restrictions, especially in Iberia and the Balkans. Such cabotage restrictions may prevent FlixBus conveying passengers _within_ countries or regions, often rendering the destinations available to passengers quite different to the route taken by the vehicle. This added complexity is not a limitation for [Aquius](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/), which always draws its route map from a user-specified _here_.

FlixBus represents an extreme test case of cabotaged international operation, since on some routes almost every place served is defined with a different set of boarding and alighting restrictions. FlixBus [host their own dynamic network map](https://www.flixbus.co.uk/bus-routes), however this can feel laggy, and does not give any indication of service frequency - destinations with one bus a week are shown just as prominantly as destinations with one bus an hour. The Aquius dataset is relatively large - almost 1 MegaByte uncompressed, even without headcode information and day-by-day service filters (which can potentially be [built from GTFS](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/gtfs/)) - but is smoother to use and more indicative of services.

## Spanish Railways

[![Aquius at Ciudad Real](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/static/aquius-ciudad-real.jpg)](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/es-rail-20-jul-2018/#x-3.296/y39.092/z7/c-3.966/k38.955/m8/s7/vlphn)

[Spanish Railways (Friday 20 July 2018)](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/es-rail-20-jul-2018/): Snapshot of all non-tourist passenger train services within Spain - [more information about this dataset](https://timhowgego.github.io/AquiusData/es-rail/). Of Interest:

* [Commercial from Madrid](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/es-rail-20-jul-2018/#x-4.340/y40.564/z7/c-3.6887/k40.4365/m10/s7/vlphn/n4) - in the pre-liberalisation summertime.
* [Teruel Existe](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/es-rail-20-jul-2018/#x-1.439/y40.676/z7/c-1.110/k40.341/m9/s7/vlphn/n1) - and then compare that to Zaragoza.
* [Bizkaia's Internals](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/es-rail-20-jul-2018/#x-2.9121/y43.2857/z11/c-2.92511/k43.25733/m13/vlhn/s5) - so just where is "Spain"?
* [OSP La Mancha](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/es-rail-20-jul-2018/#x-3.724/y39.305/z8/c-3.69/k39.32/m6/s7/vlhnp/n3) - this state supported relationship to Madrid is insightful.

### Renfe OSP

[Renfe Obligación de Servicio Público](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/renfe-osp-20-jul-2018/): As Friday 20 July 2018 above, but with custom filters for each Renfe state supported product, plus administrative boundaries.

### Renfe LD/MD

[Renfe LD/MD (10-16 December 2018)](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/renfe-ld-md-dec-2018/): GTFS extract from the first batch of Renfe open data. The extract excludes Cercanías (most suburban), Feve (metre gauge), Trenhotel (sleeper) and non-domestic services. Unlike earlier data, the extract summarises both directions across a full week, including crude time period analysis.
